```

<br>

Epiverse severity (and underreporting) pipeline illustrated with data from 100-days workshop simulated scenario data. 

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
Linelist_group3 <- read_csv("Data/Linelist_group3.csv")
head(Linelist_group3)
```

### Task 1: Identify and correct inconsistencies and errors in the data
<br>
The package [linelist](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/linelist) was used to create a `linelist` object through the `make_linelist()` function, which adds tags to df columns, that represent relevant variables in epidemiological analysis. Current tags can be checked using the function `tags()`. 
Currently (June 2023) it is necessary to install the development version of the package:

```{r}
#pak::pak("epiverse-trace/linelist")
library(linelist)
```

```{r}

linelist_3 <- make_linelist(Linelist_group3, 
                            id = "case_name", date_onset = "onset_date",
                            date_reporting = "report_date", 
                            date_admission = "hospitalisation_date", 
                            date_death = "death_date", gender = "gender", 
                            age = "age", location = "island_group", 
                            occupation = "occupation")
tags(linelist_3)
```
<br>

The function `validate_linelist()` was used to check that column formats fit the class of the corresponding tags. This is useful to perform checks on the data to ensure that it is in the right format before conducting any further analyses.

_Won't knit when using this function because it generates an error if classes are incorrect_

Multiple errors were detected, and subsequently corrected thanks to this check:

```{r}
linelist_3$onset_date <- as.Date(linelist_3$onset_date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
linelist_3$report_date <- as.Date(linelist_3$report_date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
linelist_3$hospitalisation_date <- as.Date(linelist_3$hospitalisation_date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
linelist_3$death_date <- as.Date(linelist_3$death_date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
linelist_3$gender <- as.character(linelist_3$gender)

validate_linelist(linelist_3)
```
<br>

The `lost_tags_action()` was used to determine the message that the user receives when tags are lost in the subsequent steps of the analysis, e.g., when subsetting data. Also, the `get_lost_tags_action()` is used to check which action had been set- which can be changed throughout the analysis.

```{r}
lost_tags_action("warning")
get_lost_tags_action()
```
<br>

The package [cleanepi](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/cleanepi) was used to clean linelist data. This package will include multiple functions, to remove duplicate entries, check IDs and verify that they comply with the expected format, automatically standardise dates, or calculate the age of cases included in the linelist.

_At the moment, it is not possible to use `linelist` tags to remove duplicates across columns_

```{r}
library(cleanepi)
linelist3_clean <- cleanepi(linelist_3, remove.duplicates = T, duplicates.from = c("case_name","ct_value","age","hospitalisation_date","date_first_contact","report_date","occupation","case_type","gender","onset_date","death_date","date_last_contact","island_group"), clean.col.names = T)
```

<br>

## Task 2: What is the CFR?

<br>

In this section, the packages [datadelay](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/datadelay), [epiparameter](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter), and [quickfit](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/quickfit) are used to estimate the case fatality rate of disease, while correcting the calculation to account for censoring of cases.

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics('images/Severity and underreporting pipeline.png')
```
<br>

To be able to use `datadelay`, it is necessary to first format the data as a dataframe with the number of cases, deaths, and dates of death, for which the package `incidence2` was used.

_Issue raised on `datadelay` to facilitate the input of data so that users don't have to change from a long to wide format using several lines of code_

```{r}
library(incidence2)
daily_cases_deaths <- incidence2::incidence(Linelist_group3,c("onset_date","death_date")) |> complete_dates()
daily_cases_deaths <- pivot_wider(daily_cases_deaths, names_from = count_variable, values_from = count)
names(daily_cases_deaths)[2:3]=c("deaths","cases")
daily_cases_deaths <- daily_cases_deaths[c(1,3,2)]
daily_cases_deaths$date_index <- as.Date(daily_cases_deaths$date_index)
daily_cases_deaths <- as.data.frame(daily_cases_deaths)
```

```{r}
daily_cases_deaths <- incidence2::incidence(linelist_3,c("onset_date","death_date"), groups = "island_group") |> complete_dates()
daily_cases_deaths <- pivot_wider(daily_cases_deaths, names_from = count_variable, values_from = count)
daily_cases_deaths <- daily_cases_deaths[c(1,4,3,2)]
names(daily_cases_deaths)[2:3]=c("cases","deaths")
daily_cases_deaths$date_index <- as.Date(daily_cases_deaths$date_index)
daily_cases_deaths <- as.data.frame(daily_cases_deaths)
```

<br>

The function `estimate_static()` was used to estimate the overall value of the CFR in this scenario. The argument `correct = TRUE/FALSE` allows the user to correct the CFR estimation, based on the distribution of the onset-death delay. 
On the following example, this function is used to estimate the naive and the corrected CFR, the latter by importing the onset-death distribution for Ebola from the `epiparameter` package:

```{r}
library(datadelay)
library(epiparameter)

# Naive, static CFR:
n_static_CFR <- estimate_static(daily_cases_deaths, correct_for_delays = F, location = "island_group")

# Loading delay distribution:
onset_to_death_ebola <- epiparameter::epidist_db(
  disease = "Ebola Virus Disease",
  epi_dist = "onset_to_death",
  author = "WHO_Ebola_Response_Team")

# Corrected, static CFR:
c_static_CFR <- estimate_static(daily_cases_deaths, epi_dist = onset_to_death_ebola, correct_for_delays = T, location = "island_group")

format_output(c_static_CFR, estimate_type = "severity")
```

_Q: can the location be specified so the CFR is shown in different areas?_
